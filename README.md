## Introduction
---
"Stock-Prediction-of-nifty50" project focuses on prediction the stock prices of of top 50 companies listed in nifty-50 index. The nifty-50 is a benchmark in the indian stock market that represents the performance of the top 50 companies across various sectors.

## Final Goal To Achieve
---
Final goal to achieve in this project was to predict the close price of different stocks so that we can see the the protfolio of different stocks whether it is a profitable stock or not. By analyzing past trends, patterns, and relevant market indicators, the project aims to provide insights into potential price movements and assist investors in making informed decisions.

## Data Scarpng
---
For Data Scrapping we have used BeautifulSoup and Request model in python and for Data frame we used pandas and numpy library and at last we sued csv model to convert our dataFrame into csv files.

## Data Description
---

- The prjoct involves some key stpes including data collection of top companies listed in the nift-50 index for the 4 years, data processing and model traing. Various machine learning techniques, such as regression algorithms or time series analysis can be applied to develop accurate prediction models.

- Data contains different features in the table like- Name: Name of the stock. Date: The date for which the stock price is recorded. Open Price: The opening price of the stock on a particular date. Close Price: The closing price of the stock on a particular date. High Price: The highest price reached by the stock during the day. Low Price: The lowest price reached by the stock during the day. Volume: The trading volume (number of shares) of the stock on a particular date.

- The project output includes prediction of the close price of the respective stock, or trend direction for individual Nifty 50 stocks. The predictions can be visualized through charts, graphs to provide users with a clear understanding of the projected price movements.

- Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the characteristics and distributions of the data. This involves generating summary statistics, visualizing the data through charts such as line plots, scatter plots, or correlation matrices, and identifying any interesting patterns, or relationships between variables.

- Web page creation technique used to present the profit and loss of different stocks and to see the trend for four years visulaization technique used and this includes nteractive charts, time series plots, heatmaps, or correlation matrices to effectively communicate the relationships and patterns discovered. Visualizations help stakeholders understand the data intuitively and aid in decision-making.

## Challenges Faced
---
In the scrapping i was getting different null values and duplicates so the challange was to remove these duplicates and filling of null values with the appropiate one. Creation of web page was the new task for me so writting the code to integrate the model with page was also a challenge i faced.

Overall, the "Nifty-50-Stock-Price Prediction" project aims to provide investors and market enthusiasts with a valuable tool for gaining insights into the future price movements of Nifty-50 stocks, facilitating better decision-making in the Indian stock market.
